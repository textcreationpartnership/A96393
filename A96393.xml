            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few Poſitions of the Sincere Belief and Chriſtian Doctrine
of the People of God called Quakers (to obviate Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations
and Calumnies about the ſame.)</head>
            <head type="sub">Being Inſerted as an Appendix to a Book, Entituled, A Sober Expoſtulation with ſome of the Clergy, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>1. WE, the ſaid People, are bound in Conſcience and
Duty, by the Holy Spirit, and Light of <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> only and humbly to Adore and Worſhip
the only True and Living <hi>God,</hi> Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, the Sea, and all Creatures, and
not to Adore or Worſhip any Mortal Man, or
Creature, or any other God whatſoever.</p>
            <p>II. To Believe and Confeſs the Holy Divine Three (or Scripture Trinity)
that bear Record in Heaven, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> (or <hi>Son</hi>) and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi>
and that theſe Three are Eſſentially One in the Divine Being and Subſtance,
One God, Bleſſed for Ever.</p>
            <p>III. We are livingly Taught and Led by the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> the Living Word in our Hearts (and that according to Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
to Believe, Own and Confeſs the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, his
Real Coming in the Fleſh without us; even the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that
was Conceived in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing
her, and Born of her in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> Mat. 2. 1. and that
he was Crucified, and put to Death, as concerning the Fleſh, without the
Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and we highly do Value and Eſteem his Sufferings,
Death, Precious Blood, and whole Sacrifice for Sinners; together with his
Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Heaven and Glory; and that he only was
and is the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the very <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Only Begotten Son</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God: And as for his <hi>Divinity,</hi> That he is the true Light, Life,
Power, and Wiſdom of God, and none other, according to plain Scripture
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>IV. The <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> (i. e. <hi>Manhood</hi>) of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that as
he is True God, and he is moſt Glorious Man, our Mediator and Advocate,
we livingly Believe, and have often Sincerely Confeſſed in our Publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
and Writings.</p>
            <p>V. That as ſincere and fervent Prayers to God, in the Name and Spirit
of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is the Duty of all true Believers and Chriſtians profeſſing
him, for whatſoever they ſtand in need of, eſpecially with reſpect to the
Peace and Happineſs of their Immortal Souls; ſo all who are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
under a Senſe of their <hi>Sins,</hi> in order to true Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ought to crave Forgiveneſs in the Name, and for the Sake of <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> which hath been our Practice, both Publick and Private, and God in
Mercy hath accordingly anſwered us, who by his Grace in our Hearts, hath
led many, both to confeſs and forſake Sin, that they might find Mercy in
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. Though we are bound in Conſcience truly to Eſteem and Magnifie
the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> the <hi>Ingrafted Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Us, as
ſufficient and able actually to ſave and deliver the Soul from Sin, Death and
Condemnation; and thereby we Confeſs the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> with reſpect
to his entire <hi>Exiſtence</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> as <hi>without</hi> Us, as well as we do own him Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
<hi>within</hi> Us; knowing that this <hi>Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
Teſtifie of him, and certainly Guide the truly Obedient and Sincere Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
in his Name and Power <hi>Inwardly, Livingly</hi> and <hi>Experimentally,</hi> to partake
of the Real Benefits, Fruits, and Bleſſed Ends of his <hi>outward</hi> Suffering, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
and Death for Mankind, to wit, their Repentance, Converſion from
Sin, Effectual Reconciliation unto God, Eternal Salvation, and Compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
which <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> has obtained for Us (<hi>i. e.</hi> for all Mankind)
through his Mediation and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>VII. Our Really Believing and Confeſſing the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his Paſſion,
Sufferings, Death, Atonement, and Reconciliation made <hi>for Us,</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
Aſcention and Glorification (as without us) according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
cannot be to Allegorize theſe away, as if only tranſacted within
Us (as we have been unduly Accuſed) for they were really done and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
without Us, by our Bleſſed Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> tho' our true Knowledge
of the Power and Effect of his Reſurrection, and Fellowſhip of his Sufferings,
and our being Conformable to his Death, muſt be Experienced <hi>within Us,</hi> if
ever we Live or Reign with Him.</p>
            <p>VIII. We ſincerely Prefer and Eſteem the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Teſtament,</hi> contained in that extant Book, commonly called the <hi>Bible</hi> (as moſt
Eminently Confirmed by Divine Authority, and Faithful Witneſſes) before
all other Books whatſoever extant in the World; and yet our preferring
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> (from whence the Scripture came) before the <hi>Letter</hi> of the
Scripture, is not to undervalue the Scripture, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt needs have the
Preference and Preheminence, as being the Author, and Original Cauſe, and
Dictator of the Holy Scriptures, and Giver of Light and Life alſo, whereby
truly to underſtand them, and to live accordingly.</p>
            <p>IX. As for <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> they are Scripturally conſidered
by us in their ſeveral Diſpenſations, both as in the <hi>Figure,</hi> and in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
in the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Antitype,</hi> as the Outward or Literal were Typical or
Figurative of the Inward and Spiritual, we confeſs and own, conſidered in
their Places, and proper Diſpenſations; but the Subſtance is more Excellent
and Permanent than the Shadow; as the Inward and Spiritual Grace is more
Excellent than the Outward and Viſible Signs; and as Chriſt's Spiritual <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>
which is the Saving <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> was Typified by <hi>John</hi>'s. And to Eat,
and Drink, or Sup with Chriſt in his Kingdom, of that Spiritual Meat and
Drink which he gives for Life to the Soul, was Typified or Figured forth
by his Outward Supper of the Paſſover, Bread and Cup; for the Outward
Element of Water cannot waſh away Sin from the Soul, neither can the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Bread or Cup, give Life or Nouriſhment to the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Shadows flee away, but the Sun and Subſtance remain.</p>
            <p>X. We ſincerely Believe, and have often Confeſſed the Immortality of
the Soul of Man, that was Created in God's Image, and the Doctrine of the
<hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> according as laid down in Holy Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15th
Chapter; and of Eternal Judgment by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as being Judge of the
Living, and of the Dead, in the Great and Laſt Day of Judgment, at the
Great Harveſt, which is the End of the World, God having appointed a
Day wherein he will Raiſe the Dead, both the Juſt and Unjuſt, and alſo
Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that (Heavenly and moſt Glorious)
Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> whom he hath ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. before whoſe Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Seat
all muſt appear, to Receive their Final Judgment and Sentence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Deeds done in the Body, whether they be Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>XI. That <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Goſpel Miniſtry muſt be free, without forced Maintenance
filthy Lucre, or Covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>XII. That Magiſtracy, or Civil Government, is God's Ordinance; the
Good Ends thereof being for the Puniſhment of Evil Doers, and Praiſe of
them that do Well.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things we Sincerely Believe and Own; and we know no Doctrine
or Principle (Preached, Maintained, or Received among, or by Us, ſince
we were a People) contrary to theſe before-mentioned; nor do we Own
any contrary thereunto.</p>

            <p>1. That we ſincerely Believe and Confeſs, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who
